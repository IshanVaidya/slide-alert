# slide-alert
This application helps in predicting landslides in a given location. 
Major contributors to landslides are 
-amount of precipitation
-water seepage through soil
-resistance of soil towards external forces
-forest cover

We look to make use of the following to make prediction decisions
-Optical sensors-- To check for soil color, plantation cover. These will be used to check for the organic matter and clay content in the soil, which shows its holidng capacity
-Mechanical sensors-- To check for resistance of soil against external forces
-Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors-- To check for moisture content in soil.
-Airflow Sensors-- Measure soil air permeability.

We will add precipitation statistics of the region to the data collected by these sensors, so as to make better decisions.
Protypes will be established in various locations to get sample data against which predictions will be performed.
Tools used for development--
Python, C/C++.
